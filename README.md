The useState hook is used to manage state within functional components. In this problem, the hobbies state holds an array of strings representing user's hobbies.

The component dynamically renders input fields based on the hobbies state array. Users can add new hobbies by clicking the "Add Hobby" button, which updates the state 
and triggers a re-render.Event handlers are defined inline within JSX. 

The Remove button for each input field is disabled for the first input field (`index === 0`).

This prevents users from removing all input fields and ensures that at least one hobby input field is always present.
